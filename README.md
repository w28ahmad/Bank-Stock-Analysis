# Bank-Stock-Analysis
Conducted exploratory data analysis of stock prices to better understand financial crisis of 2007â€“2008 and their effect on US-Banks. I analyzed Bank of America, CitiGroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo stocks. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008
